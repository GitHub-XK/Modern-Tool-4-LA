2.1 Introduction to Artificial Intelligent

2.1.1 Artificial Intelligent

As a designer, my beginning understand of Artificial Intelligent is a robots as smart as human. This technology sounds obscure to understand and far from designer's daily job and life. It is a branch of computer science which is very different from design or natural science field. However, we used this technology almost everywhere in our life. For example, the auto drive car, the Amazon recommend advertisements, the weather forecast prediction, the postal code recognize system from postal office, and all the voice assistance like Siri, google assistant, Alexa. They are all artificial intelligence. There is huge potential that AI will broadly be employed by every industry and replace most of the human labor, especially in financial industry. Landscape design field will not escape this revolution. Imagine in the future, artificial intelligent program could provide the best design solutions and various design styles with simple input of big data of the site. It is important to understand this technology and its possibilities as a temporary designer facing the pressure of application of new technology.

Let's start with the definition and brief history of Artificial Intelligent. Artificial Intelligent basically is ... . The concept became popular because of the Alpha go win the game with xiangqi master. It was saw as a monument of articial Intelligent.

2.3 Related Tools and Tutorial

2.3.1 Python, Keras, TensorFlow, Azure

Programming and computing is the foundation of the artificial intelligent. It is great if designer has some programming knowledge. Python and R are the main programming languages that artificial intelligent program build from. It is recommended to learn Python since it is simple, easy to understand and broadly used. Based on Python, there are many awesome open-source machine learning framework we can directly build on, for example: TensorFlow, Keras, and Azure. If you not interested in learning boring hard programming knowledge, there are also great tools that we could directly borrowed from whiteout knowing any programming knowledge.  

Python: We are not teaching you how to Program with Python, but telling you what is Python and what it can do. If you like to learn, there are tons of great resource on the internet you could study.

TensorFlow and Keras: supposed we have some basic knowledge about python. We will do a small project to identify landscape images by tensorflow and keras framework.

2.4 Discussion: Will AI replace traditional designer soon? What should we do?

According to the survey, there is only 5% chance that Artificial intelligence will replace landscape architect in next 2 decades. However, it just the subjective acknowledgement and attitude toward artificial intelligent and landscape architecture from public. What scientist devote to achieve is to invent the technology that could be smart enough to afford the design job, or even superior to the human intelligence.

There are several papers discussing this question: will AI replace traditional designer's job? Let's see what these reporter think. ...

Living in the current situation, what is the best move for a landscape architecture designer? What my suggested is keep learning and keep updating your self, be sensitive and welcome the new trend in the field would be a wise behavior.
