2.1 Introduction to Artificial Intelligent

2.1.1 Artificial Intelligent

As a designer, my beginning understand of Artificial Intelligent is a robots as smart as human. This technology sounds obscure to understand and far from designer's daily job and life. It is a branch of computer science which is very different from design or natural science field. However, we used this technology almost everywhere in our life. For example, the auto drive car, the Amazon recommend advertisements, the weather forecast prediction, the postal code recognize system from postal office, and all the voice assistance like Siri, google assistant, Alexa. They are all artificial intelligence. There is huge potential that AI will broadly be employed by every industry and replace most of the human labor, especially in financial industry. Landscape design field will not escape this revolution. Imagine in the future, artificial intelligent program could provide the best design solutions and various design styles with simple input of big data of the site. It is important to understand this technology and its possibilities as a temporary designer facing the pressure of application of new technology.

Let's start with the definition and brief history of Artificial Intelligent. Artificial Intelligent basically is ... . The concept became popular because of the Alpha go win the game with international chess master. It was considered as a monument of articial Intelligent.

2.1.2 AI, ML, DL, Big Data ...

These are the popular words often pop up in the highlight title of the news. What are they? and How does it relate to our daily life?

Artificial Intelligent(AI): a. a branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of the intelligent behavior in computer. b. the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. ([https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artificial%20intelligence](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artificial intelligence))

Machine Learning(ML): a subset of artificial intelligence. It is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

Deep Learning(DL): also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning, is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)

Big Data: is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with traditional data-processing application software. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data)

Data Science: is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)



A more vivid example to illustrate these concepts. AI is more like a robot that simulate human behavior and replacing labor works. ML is studying how the programming logic works so the robots could be smarter. DL is one of the ML methods based on neural networks. Big Data basically is a large amount of exercise that trains robot smart and accurate. Data Science processes big data to be accurate, concise, organized, and easy to understand for both human and robots. 

If we see the big data is raw food, today is the era of world cornucopia since the advancement of smart phone and internet. However, you can not eat these raw food directly. Data science is like big food company collecting big data, then cleaning, filtering, categorizing, transforming, packing these food that people can use or eat. AI is like human, their growth and population has to be based on the food resource. Once the AI is eating more accurate processed food, they become smarter and stronger, and could finish work fast and accurate.

2.2 Application of Artificial Intelligent in Landscape Architecture

Once we have a general idea of these items, we could start to think about how landscape could be impacted, or married with them. Following are some interesting landscape projects related to AI or Big Data

2.2.1 SWA: Live and Learn(https://landscapearchitecturemagazine.org/tag/artificial-intelligence/)

2.2.2 Bradley Cantrell explores what artificial intelligence could mean for Mother Earth (https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/2017/02/bradley-cantrell-explores-what-artificial-intelligence-could-mean-for-mother-earth/)

2.2.3 Landscape-freestyle: restyling site plans for landscape architecture with machine learning(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331427749_Landscape-freestyle_restyling_site_plans_for_landscape_architecture_with_machine_learning)

2.2.4 Using Street-level Images and Deep Learning for Urban Landscape STUDIES (http://journal.hep.com.cn/laf/EN/10.15302/J-LAF-20180203#1)

2.2.5 Image Cut Out Tool: Using the AI to cut out trees, people in one click, it is much accurate and faster then manually cutout or photoshop cutout. There are several tools online you can use: 

- [[remove.bg]](https://www.remove.bg/): It is a program using AI/ML to remove the background of a image. Comparing to tradition methods, it only needs 5 seconds to generate the output with one click, or several lines of code. Once you sign up the account, you can generate an API key which could have 50 times cutout preview per month. No drawing, no selection, the process is totally automatically. The result is amazing and high quality.





2.3 Related Tools and Tutorial

2.3.1 Python, Keras, TensorFlow, Azure

Programming and computing is the foundation of the artificial intelligent. It is great if designer has some programming knowledge. Python and R are the main programming languages that artificial intelligent program build from. It is recommended to learn Python since it is simple, easy to understand and broadly used. Based on Python, there are many awesome open-source machine learning framework we can directly build on, for example: TensorFlow, Keras, and Azure. If you not interested in learning boring hard programming knowledge, there are also great tools that we could directly borrowed from whiteout knowing any programming knowledge.  

Python: We are not teaching you how to Program with Python, but telling you what is Python and what it can do. If you like to learn, there are tons of great resource on the internet you could study.

TensorFlow and Keras: supposed we have some basic knowledge about python. We will do a small project to identify landscape images by tensorflow and keras framework.



2.3.2 Direct AI Tools we could use

If you do not like coding or programming, there are still powerful tools built from AI that you can directly use from website or software without knowing or learning how it works. The tools relevant to landscape architecture are mostly image/video processing tools, space/pattern making tools, and geographic information tools. The others maybe also helpful indirectly to design projects.

2.4 Discussion: Will AI replace traditional designer soon? What should we do?

According to the survey, there is only 5% chance that Artificial intelligence will replace landscape architect in next 2 decades. However, it just the subjective acknowledgement and attitude toward artificial intelligent and landscape architecture from public. What scientist devote to achieve is to invent the technology that could be smart enough to afford the design job, or even superior to the human intelligence.

There are several papers discussing this question: will AI replace traditional designer's job? Let's see what these reporter think. ...

Living in the current situation, what is the best move for a landscape architecture designer? What my suggested is keep learning and keep updating yourself, be sensitive and welcome the new trend in the field would be a wise behavior. 

Even technology is advance, application of technology or public access are unpredictable, and usually take decades to achieve, or even fail to be accepted. The era of AI may never come true. However, it may also come really fast. Be knowledgeable, be welcoming will definitely help to prepare for the unknown of the future.
