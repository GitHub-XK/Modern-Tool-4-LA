## Presentation Schedule

#### Week 1 - GIS & Mapping: QGIS, OpenStreetMap, Mapbox

1. Introduction to GIS. What is the meaning to landscape architecture? It is a tool that converts raw geological information to the information and graphics that useful for landscape architectures to best present site conditions and design ideas.
2. QGIS vs ArcGIS: the two most popular GIS software on the market. Here is a general comparison about QGIS and ArcGIS: a. similar functions. b. QGIS is open source and free, while ArcGIS is expensive. c. QGIS is easy to learn, while ArcGIS is sort of complicated. d. QGIS works on both Windows and MacOS, while ArcGIS only works on Windows.  Since it is easy and free, it is definitely recommended to learn QGIS as the beginning of  GIS study.
3. Go through a new project, introducing the basic interfaces and functions of the software.
4. Where to get the geological information from the internet? a. topo information: lidar / Grayscale Height Map: Geological Data Gateway, Local Government website. --> vector contour, slope, hill shade, watershed, sun aspect ...    b. existing raster map resource: openstreetmap, esri maps, bing maps, google maps, customized maps --> export as a base map (High Res)      c. vector data from openstreetmap --> fast get city information about road, building, green space zoning ...  (when we need a CAD base of the site to start with).  d. vector data from local government gis database (REST api) --> Most updated and complete vector data (it has a little bit complicated process, but best result. Not every local government has its own gis database)  e. Customized beatified raster maps from Mapbox -->   export customized high res base map
5. What else QGIS can do? 
6. Q&A
7. PPT
