### Modern Tools for Landscape Architecture

#### Introduction
Landscape Architecture industry in these 20 years, is growing fast and is recognized as a mature market globally. However, the design process and the design tool for most of the landscape architecture firms has not changed much. With the aggressive internet / information blooming and technology advancement, tons of amazing new tools has been created in different diverse fields. These tools would highly improve the efficiency and experience of design working process. However, most of the professional practice or even academic has never heard about these tools exist. 

In this book, we will introduce you these useful tools and related practical skills.

### Part 3: Internet & Data (mining, scraping, organizing, customizing)

Introduction: Landscape architecture design can not build without accurate information. It is extremely important to access rich data set and analyze them before designing or implementing design solutions. In the past all the important information are stored at national agencies, like libraries, governments, geological department, and universities. Designers or publics often hardly could obtain these information. With growing of internet, and boosting of data and information, designers could easily access large amount of data without too much effort. However, because of the technology barrier, sometimes we don't know where and how to get them and convert to useful data that designer could use. For landscape architecture, geological data is extremely valuable and important. There are many sources and tools most of the landscape architects barely know where or how to use. This chapter will introduce several resources and tools that would essentially help designer to access useful data set.
