Part 3: Internet & Data

Introduction: Landscape architecture design can not build without accurate information. It is extremely important to access rich data set and analyze them before designing or implementing design solutions. In the past all the important information are stored at national agencies, like libraries, governments, geological department, and universities. Designers or publics often hardly could obtain these information. With growing of internet, and boosting of data and information, designers could easily access large amount of data without too much effort. However, because of the technology barrier, sometimes we don't know where and how to get them and convert to useful data that designer could use. For landscape architecture, geological data is extremely valuable and important. There are many sources and tools most of the landscape architects barely know where or how to use. This chapter will introduce several resources and tools that would essentially help designer to access useful data set.

Chapter 6: Open Street Map

6.1 Introduction to Open Street Map

6.1.1 What is Open Street Map(OSM)?

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. The geodata underlying the map is considered the primary output of the project. The creation and growth of OSM has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map data across much of the world, and the advent of inexpensive portable satellite navigation devices. OSM is considered a prominent example of volunteered geographic information. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap)(https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/About_OpenStreetMap)
