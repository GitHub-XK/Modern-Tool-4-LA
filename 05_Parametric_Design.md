Chapter 5: Parametric Design / Modeling

5.1 Introduction to Parametric Design / Modeling

Basically, all the computer aided design (CAD) could also be seen as a domain of parametric design. You can not see the parametric since it manipulates and renders through visual graphics. 

5.1.1 Definition of Parametric Design and History of Parametric Design

"Parametric design is a process based on algorithmic thinking that enables the expression of parameters and rules that, together, define, encode and clarify the relationship between design intent and design response." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_design) Similar terms include procedural modeling, fractal modeling, and generative modeling. 



5.1.2 What is BIM? BIM vs Parametric Design

Building Information Modeling (BIM)  is a process supported by various tools, technologies and contracts involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of places.  



5.1.2 Software related to Parametric Design

- Autodesk Revit / Dynamo
-  Rhinoceros 3D / Grasshopper
- Autodesk 3DS Max
- Autodesk Maya
- Python



5.1.3 Bionic Modeling? / Organic Modeling?

 

5.2 Application of Parametric Design / Modeling in Landscape Architecture

5.2.1 Codify: Parametric and Computational Design in Landscape Architecture(https://www.amazon.com/Codify-Parametric-Computational-Landscape-Architecture/dp/1138125032/ref=asc_df_1138125032/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=366282014808&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1610764910352533758&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9032082&hvtargid=pla-795723067582&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=79033899031&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=366282014808&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1610764910352533758&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9032082&hvtargid=pla-795723067582) Need read and abstract new points from the book.
