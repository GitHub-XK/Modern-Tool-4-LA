Chapter 5: Parametric Design / Modeling



*The form of the house is not amorphous, not a free for all form. On the contrary, its construction has strict boundaries according to the scale of your living. Its shape and form are determined by inherent life processes.* â€”Frederick Kiesler.



5.1 Introduction to Parametric Design / Modeling

Basically, all the computer aided design (CAD) could also be seen as a domain of parametric design. You can not see the parametric since it manipulates and renders through visual graphics. 

5.1.1 Definition of Parametric Design and History of Parametric Design

"Parametric design is a process based on algorithmic thinking that enables the expression of parameters and rules that, together, define, encode and clarify the relationship between design intent and design response." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_design) Similar terms include procedural modeling, fractal modeling, and generative modeling.

5.1.2 What is BIM? BIM vs Parametric Design

Building Information Modeling (BIM)  is a process supported by various tools, technologies and contracts involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of places.  

"The technical approach for Building Information Modeling is inherently parametric" (Eastman et al, 2011, Chapter 2).  Because, the process of modeling is done by adjusting parametric objects. These objects has different properties which could be adjusted by inputting the property values of parameters. The different between Building Information Modeling and  Parametric Design is that BIM model behaves like an assembly of independent object, while, Parametric Design project is more like a single assembly with full control of overall form and smaller details.

5.1.3 Bionic Architecture Modeling

Bionic Architecture: is a movement for the design and construction of expressive buildings whose layout and lines borrow from natural (i.e. biological) forms. The movement began to mature in the early 21st century, and thus in early designs research was stressed over practicality. One of the tasks set themselves by the movement's early pioneers was the development of aesthetic and economic justifications for their approach to architecture.

5.2 Application of Parametric Design / Modeling in Landscape Architecture

5.2.2 Why landscape architecture need parametric design?

The parametric design is primarily target for Architecture Domain. And it perfectly fit the feature of Architecture design - simplicity on the elements and effectors, and complexity on the variations. Landscape Architecture Design has much complex situations and much more impactors. It seems impossible to do a landscape project through parametric design. However, with the era of internet and big data, it is worth investigating how to integrate parametric design into Landscape Architecture design process. Developers and designers have been put great efforts on landscape parametric design, and have created amazing tools to increase efficiency of landscape parametric design and modeling.
