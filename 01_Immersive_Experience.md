### Part 1: Immersive Experience-- Visualization and Spatialization

**Keywords: Simulation, Design, Representation**

simulation is an important activities for human's development and designer's creative ideas. Design ideas need simulation as the material and drawing boards to start with, so we build base maps, concept models. While, it also needs the simulation to represent the design ideas, like perspective drawing and construction document. Without simulation process, design is just a vague thoughts. Computer virtual simulation it one of the most important simulation technology. It had been heavily used at military and industry. With the computing technology hugely improved, the computer simulation has been used broadly in movie and game industry to enhance the people's sensation and experience. Immersive is the word to describe the future simulation experience.
