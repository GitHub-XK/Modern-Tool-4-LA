### Part 1: Immersive Experience-- Visualization and Spatialization

**Keywords: Simulation, Design, Representation**

simulation is an important activities for human's development and designer's creative ideas. Design ideas need simulation as the material and drawing boards to start with, so we build base maps, concept models. While, it also needs the simulation to represent the design ideas, like perspective drawing and construction document. Without simulation process, design is just a vague thoughts. Computer virtual simulation it one of the most important simulation technology. It had been heavily used at military and industry. With the computing technology hugely improved, the computer simulation has been used broadly in movie and game industry to enhance the people's sensation and experience. Immersive is the word to describe the future simulation experience.

Since the heat of VR(Virtual Reality) technology and the new VR devices, Oculus published in 2015, many fields of design started thinking VR as a new possibility. In industry, Architecture and Landscape Architecture firms take the first step to experiment with VR in next few years. It is an exciting moment for the designers who wish to embrace the new technologies and adventures(experiments/exploration). Would the VR be the new revolution same as the time when computer populated in landscape fields? It may need a longer time to respond this question.  

In the first part of the book, various of cutting-edge simulation technologies will be introduced, including Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality. From history, definition to applications and possibilities in Landscape, and case studies, this chapter will guide designer to the world of modern design technologies step by step. 

#### Chapter 1: Virtual Reality

##### 1.1 Introduction and History of Virtual Reality 

Definition: the computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional image or environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using special electronic equipment, such as a helmet with a screen inside or gloves fitted with sensors.

If you haven't experience virtual reality before, here is my personal definition after I first time trying VR: Virtual Reality normally indicate a device with headset goggle (sometime also has a controller), which can create a visually and sonically (audio?) closed 3-dimensional virtual environment for audience. Your view and hearing directions within the goggle are synchronously responding to your head rotating and moving. It feels like you are in the virtual world. With the controller, you can move your locations and interact (not limited to create, remove, edit, grab, hit, throw, touch, trigger) with virtual object according to the program / game it running with. 

Through different definitions, it was found that they all emphasis that "VR is an interactive and immersive (with the feeling of presence) experience in a simulated (autonomous) world"(refer same above).

The current VR is naturally booming in gaming and movie (entertainment) industry products according to its function and target groups. However, it comes a long way before it populating to the public. 

The very first idea of it was presented by Ivan Sutherland in 1965: “make that (virtual) world in the
window look real, sound real, feel real, and respond realistically to the viewer’s actions”

#### History of Virtual Reality

- **Sensorama**: in 1960-1962, the first virtual reality system was created by Morton Helig. It is a multi-sensory simulator. "A prerecorded film in color and stereo, was augmented by binaural sound, scent, wind and vibration experience."

- **The Ultimate Display**: in 1965, an artificial world construction concept was proposed by Ivan Sutherland. This virtual reality system includes interactive graphics, force-feedback, sound, smell and taste. 
- **Sword of Damocles**: In 1968 Ivan Sutherland and his student Bob Sproull created the first Head Mounted Display(HMD) that was connected to a computer instead of a camera. Since the head tracking technology, it supported a real-time stereo view according to the position and orientation of  user's head. However, the device was large and heavy. People would need to be strapped into the device, which was suspended from the ceiling (describe as its name) . The graphics that the computer generated were very basic wireframe rooms and objects. ![SwordOfDamocles-1](https://www.vrs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ivan-sword-of-damocles.jpg)

- **VIDEOPLACE**: "Artificial Reality" was the term that Myron Kruegere, a virtual reality computer artist, used to express his series of experiences. VIDEOPLACE was the best representation of his idea. In this system, the silhouettes of the users grabbed by the cameras were projected on a large screen. It enabled people to interact one with the other in a responsive virtual environment despite distance. ![VIDEOPLACE-1](http://thedigitalage.pbworks.com/w/page/22039083/f/videoplace.jpg) ![VIDEOPLACE-2](http://thedigitalage.pbworks.com/f/1259016779/videoplace_systemarchit.gif)

*"The video medium has the potential of being more rich and variable in some ways, than reality itself."* -Krueger

- **VPL**: the Visual Programming Lab (VPL) company, founded by Jaron Lanier in 1987, created the first commercially available VR devices - the DataGlove ($9,000) in 1985 and the Eyephone HMD (EyePhone 1 $9,400; EyePhone HRX $49,000) in 1988. 
- **[Walkthrough Project](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~walk/overview/index.html)**: an architectural walkthrough application was developed at the University of North Carolina in 1989. Several VR devices were created to improve the quality of this system. E.g. HMDs, optical trackers and the Pixel-Plane graphics engine.
- **CAVE**: The first CAVE was invented by Carolina Cruz-Neira, Daniel J. Sandin, and Thomas A. DeFanti at University of Illinois, Chicago Electronic Visualization Laboratory in 1992. A Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) is an immersive virtual reality environment which is a cube room with 6 projecting walls.  ![CAVE-1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/CAVE_Crayoland.jpg)



#### Virtual reality in the 21st century

At beginning of the 21st century, great advancement was achieved in the development of virtual reality. Computer technology, especially the portable and powerful smart phone technologies, have been broadly populated since it became cheap enough for people to afford easily. By using smartphone with high-density displays and advanced 3D graphics capabilities, a generation of lightweight convenience virtual reality devices were exploded in the market. Google Cardboard and Galaxy Gear are representing this type of VR devices.  ![GoogleCardBoard](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MAwTQ5qs2ogQg_NSBQTh3nrG78sMRALh9MGWzvlB5-t63NLtQyI3HBJttOL9Owx5fcE)

Virtual Reality became the real heat in 2015. It is the year thousands of VR games, app, and programs flooding out in the market. Multiple VR products were saling in the digital stores. It seems that everyone is interested in trying the VR and have one in home to replace the tv and playstation. 



##### 1.2 VR, AR, MR, XR & Hologram

Besides VR, we also heard some similar words: AR, MR, XR or Hologram. What are they? What are the differences comparing to VR? 

**AR** stands for **Augmented Reality**, it is basically a technology that overlay the proposed virtual element to the real world space through smart phone camera. What it distinguishes from VR is that VR creates a entire closed virtual environment despite the outside world, while AR uses the real world space as the environment setting, and add proposed virtual alteration to the setting.

Similar to AR, **Mixed Reality** (**MR**), is the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time. Holo Lens in one of the MR products. An example of MR project is [Architectural Solar Analysis Tool for Microsoft Hololens](https://coarchitects.com/basics-an-architectural-solar-analysis-tool-for-microsoft-hololens/).

A first in Singapore, students at Crescent Girls’ School don the Microsoft HoloLens for Biology lessons to investigate the impact of nuclear accidents on the surrounding ecosystems. From Singapore News Center.

"**Extended Reality** (**XR**) is a newly added term to the dictionary of the technical words. For now, only a few people are aware of XR. Extended Reality refers to all real-and-virtual combined environments and human-machine interactions generated by computer technology and wearables. Extended Reality includes all its descriptive forms like the Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality (MR). In other words, XR can be defined as an umbrella, which brings all three Reality (AR, VR, MR) together under one term, leading to less public confusion. Extended reality provides a wide variety and vast number of levels in the Virtuality of partially sensor inputs to Immersive Virtuality."(https://medium.com/@northof41/what-really-is-the-difference-between-ar-mr-vr-xr-35bed1da1a4e)

Hologram is another technology that very different from XR. "It is an image that appears to be three dimensional and which can be seen with the naked eye. Typically, a hologram is a photographic recording of a light field, rather than an image formed by a lens. "(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography)

The trend in 2020, VR would be generally populate through different industry. AR would be the most fast growing technology being used in our daily life since the broad support from the mobile phone manufactures. From iphone 7 to the latest iphone 11, they have ARKit to strongly support AR program running on iphone. Beside Apple, Samsung, Huawei or OnePlus, they have ARCore to make sure AR program can easily running on the Android platform. Since the high coverage of smart phone users, AR become the most easy technology people and experience and enjoy. 



##### 1.3 Applications of VR

VR could be used in many areas in industry and daily life. It started with inventions, scientific experiments. The first field has large demand is millitary and nasa.  In the end of the 20th, there is a heat of VR in game industry, but not last long since the expensive price and the lack of powerful computer and graphic technology. After the Oculus, many field start to experiment and use it as an important tool. Especially in Architecture, Gaming, Movie, Medicine and Education field. 

1.3.1 Architectural Visualization

5 Steps to Make VR a Reality in Your Practice By MICHAEL KILKELLY (https://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/5-steps-to-make-vr-a-reality-in-your-practice_o)

((CO Architects discovered that VR helps fill in unknowns during the design process. Exploring a concept model in a fully immersive environment allows architects and clients to understand it better. Likewise, VR lets designers test different options at full-scale early in the process. VR also has visceral appeal. “Not everyone can read drawings,” says CO principal Eyal Perchik, AIA, “but everyone can relate to VR.” In the firm's VR mock-ups of complex lab and healthcare spaces, doctors and nurses could virtually work in a space, testing its layout and scale long before it's constructed. Currently, all projects at CO employ VR in some capacity.

[Hickok Cole Architects](http://www.hickokcole.com/) in Washington, D.C., began exploring VR through its in-house [iLab](http://www.hickokcole.com/ilab/research-innovation/) program, which provides micro-grants for employees to research new ideas and technologies. Recipients Carlyn Luu, a project architect, and Howard Mack, a design technology specialist, explored potential applications of VR tools in design, presentation, and marketing. In design, Luu and Mack used VR to highlight unresolved issues at the forthcoming [International Spy Museum](https://www.spymuseum.org/), for which Hickok Cole is the architect of record. By sharing the VR model with the client, they realized that they could not curate carefully styled views of the project as they could with conventional 3D renderings—the client could explore the model however they saw fit. Hickok Cole is currently using VR on three projects with plans to roll it out on more projects soon.))

##### 1.5 How to convert Design into VR?

1.5.1 By Rendering Software: Enscape, V-Ray, Lumion

Rendering is an important process for landscape architects to better represent design to clients. Most of the designers are familiar with one or more rendering software. Since the mature of the virtual reality technology in market, the major render software start to integrate Virtual Reality function into the new version. For example: Lumion 9.0, V-Ray RT 4.0 and so on. Enscape is a new render engine which could real-time render the model, and directly convert to VR output.

1.5.2  By Game Engine: Unity3D, Unreal Engine

Gaming is the biggest industry by employing virtual reality. Game engine certainly will include this function as an important part of system. The most popular game engine on the market: Unity3D and Unreal Engine are all supporting export VR right know.

For landscape designer, it is easy to convert 3d model from SketchUp or Rhino into Unity3D and Unreal Engine. And it is not hard to build an interactive virtual landscape environment through these Game Engine even without programming knowledge. 

Unity3D and Unreal has similar functionality. However Unreal Engine has great graphic quality, while, Unity3D has great asset store and easy to learn.

Following is the tutorial to import Rhino/Sketchup model into Game Engine and Build simple interactive scene in VIrtual Reality:
