### Part 1: Immersive Experience-- Visualization and Spatialization

**Keywords: Simulation, Design, Representation**

simulation is an important activities for human's development and designer's creative ideas. Design ideas need simulation as the material and drawing boards to start with, so we build base maps, concept models. While, it also needs the simulation to represent the design ideas, like perspective drawing and construction document. Without simulation process, design is just a vague thoughts. Computer virtual simulation it one of the most important simulation technology. It had been heavily used at military and industry. With the computing technology hugely improved, the computer simulation has been used broadly in movie and game industry to enhance the people's sensation and experience. Immersive is the word to describe the future simulation experience.

Since the heat of VR(Virtual Reality) technology and the new VR devices, Oculus published in 2015, many fields of design started thinking VR as a new possibility. In industry, Architecture and Landscape Architecture firms take the first step to experiment with VR in next few years. It is an exciting moment for the designers who wish to embrace the new technologies and adventures(experiments/exploration). Would the VR be the new revolution same as the time when computer populated in landscape fields? It may need a longer time to respond this question.  

In the first part of the book, various of cutting-edge simulation technologies will be introduced, including Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality. From history, definition to applications and possibilities in Landscape, and case studies, this chapter will guide designer to the world of modern design technologies step by step. 

#### Chapter 1: Virtual Reality

##### 1.1 Introduction and History of Virtual Reality 

Definition: the computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional image or environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way by a person using special electronic equipment, such as a helmet with a screen inside or gloves fitted with sensors.

If you haven't experience virtual reality before, here is my personal definition after I first time trying VR: Virtual Reality normally indicate a device with headset goggle (sometime also has a controller), which can create a visually and sonically (audio?) closed 3-dimensional virtual environment for audience. Your view and hearing directions within the goggle are synchronously responding to your head rotating and moving. It feels like you are in the virtual world. With the controller, you can move your locations and interact (not limited to create, remove, edit, grab, hit, throw, touch, trigger) with virtual object according to the program / game it running with. 

Through different definitions, it was found that they all emphasis that "VR is an interactive and immersive (with the feeling of presence) experience in a simulated (autonomous) world"(refer same above).

The current VR is naturally booming in gaming and movie (entertainment) industry products according to its function and target groups. However, it comes a long way before it populating to the public. 

The very first idea of it was presented by Ivan Sutherland in 1965: “make that (virtual) world in the
window look real, sound real, feel real, and respond realistically to the viewer’s actions”

#### History of Virtual Reality

- **Sensorama**: in 1960-1962, the first virtual reality system was created by Morton Helig. It is a multi-sensory simulator. "A prerecorded film in color and stereo, was augmented by binaural sound, scent, wind and vibration experience."

    ![Sensorama-1](https://www.vrs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sensorama2.jpg) ![Sensorama-2](https://www.vrs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sensorama-patent.png)

- **The Ultimate Display**: in 1965, an artificial world construction concept was proposed by Ivan Sutherland. This virtual reality system includes interactive graphics, force-feedback, sound, smell and taste. 
- **Sword of Damocles**: In 1968 Ivan Sutherland and his student Bob Sproull created the first Head Mounted Display(HMD) that was connected to a computer instead of a camera. Since the head tracking technology, it supported a real-time stereo view according to the position and orientation of  user's head. However, the device was large and heavy. People would need to be strapped into the device, which was suspended from the ceiling (describe as its name) . The graphics that the computer generated were very basic wireframe rooms and objects. ![SwordOfDamocles-1](https://www.vrs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ivan-sword-of-damocles.jpg)

- **VIDEOPLACE**: "Artificial Reality" was the term that Myron Kruegere, a virtual reality computer artist, used to express his series of experiences. VIDEOPLACE was the best representation of his idea. In this system, the silhouettes of the users grabbed by the cameras were projected on a large screen. It enabled people to interact one with the other in a responsive virtual environment despite distance. ![VIDEOPLACE-1](http://thedigitalage.pbworks.com/w/page/22039083/f/videoplace.jpg) ![VIDEOPLACE-2](http://thedigitalage.pbworks.com/f/1259016779/videoplace_systemarchit.gif)

*"The video medium has the potential of being more rich and variable in some ways, than reality itself."* -Krueger

- **VPL**: the Visual Programming Lab (VPL) company, founded by Jaron Lanier in 1987, created the first commercially available VR devices - the DataGlove ($9,000) in 1985 and the Eyephone HMD (EyePhone 1 $9,400; EyePhone HRX $49,000) in 1988. 
- **[Walkthrough Project](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~walk/overview/index.html)**: an architectural walkthrough application was developed at the University of North Carolina in 1986. Several VR devices were created to improve the quality of this system. E.g. HMDs, optical trackers and the Pixel-Plane graphics engine.
- **CAVE**: The first CAVE was invented by Carolina Cruz-Neira, Daniel J. Sandin, and Thomas A. DeFanti at University of Illinois, Chicago Electronic Visualization Laboratory in 1992. A Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) is an immersive virtual reality environment which is a cube room with 6 projecting walls.  ![CAVE-1](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/CAVE_Crayoland.jpg)



#### Virtual reality in the 21st century

At beginning of the 21st century, great advancement was achieved in the development of virtual reality. Computer technology, especially the portable and powerful smart phone technologies, have been broadly populated since it became cheap enough for people to afford easily. By using smartphone with high-density displays and advanced 3D graphics capabilities, a generation of lightweight convenience virtual reality devices were exploded in the market. Google Cardboard and Galaxy Gear are representing this type of VR devices.  ![GoogleCardBoard](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MAwTQ5qs2ogQg_NSBQTh3nrG78sMRALh9MGWzvlB5-t63NLtQyI3HBJttOL9Owx5fcE)

Virtual Reality became the real heat in 2015. It is the year thousands of VR games, app, and programs flooding out in the market. Multiple VR products were saling in the digital stores. It seems that everyone is interested in trying the VR and have one in home to replace the tv and playstation. 



##### 1.2 VR, AR, MR, XR & Hologram

Besides VR, we also heard some similar words: AR, MR, XR or Hologram. What are they? What are the differences comparing to VR? 

**AR** stands for **Augmented Reality**, it is basically a technology that overlay the proposed virtual element to the real world space through smart phone camera. What it distinguishes from VR is that VR creates a entire closed virtual environment despite the outside world, while AR uses the real world space as the environment setting, and add proposed virtual alteration to the setting.

Similar to AR, **Mixed Reality** (**MR**), is the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time. Holo Lens in one of the MR products. An example of MR project is [Architectural Solar Analysis Tool for Microsoft Hololens](https://coarchitects.com/basics-an-architectural-solar-analysis-tool-for-microsoft-hololens/). 

![MR](https://3er1viui9wo30pkxh1v2nh4w-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/439/2019/02/CGS-Students-on-the-Hololens-2-e2.jpg)

A first in Singapore, students at Crescent Girls’ School don the Microsoft HoloLens for Biology lessons to investigate the impact of nuclear accidents on the surrounding ecosystems. From Singapore News Center.

"**Extended Reality** (**XR**) is a newly added term to the dictionary of the technical words. For now, only a few people are aware of XR. Extended Reality refers to all real-and-virtual combined environments and human-machine interactions generated by computer technology and wearables. Extended Reality includes all its descriptive forms like the Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality (MR). In other words, XR can be defined as an umbrella, which brings all three Reality (AR, VR, MR) together under one term, leading to less public confusion. Extended reality provides a wide variety and vast number of levels in the Virtuality of partially sensor inputs to Immersive Virtuality."(https://medium.com/@northof41/what-really-is-the-difference-between-ar-mr-vr-xr-35bed1da1a4e)

Hologram is another technology that very different from XR. "It is an image that appears to be three dimensional and which can be seen with the naked eye. Typically, a hologram is a photographic recording of a light field, rather than an image formed by a lens. "(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography)

![Hologram](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2405/5043/products/product-image-432976892_010a1a8f-7eba-43f5-812b-877b834affc4_720x.jpg?v=1571709981)

The trend in 2020, VR would be generally populate through different industry. AR would be the most fast growing technology being used in our daily life since the broad support from the mobile phone manufactures. From iphone 7 to the latest iphone 11, they have ARKit to strongly support AR program running on iphone. Beside Apple, Samsung, Huawei or OnePlus, they have ARCore to make sure AR program can easily running on the Android platform. Since the high coverage of smart phone users, AR become the most easy technology people and experience and enjoy. 



##### 1.3 Applications of VR

VR could be used in many areas in industry and daily life. It started with inventions, scientific experiments. The first field has large demand is millitary and nasa.  In the end of the 20th, there is a heat of VR in game industry, but not last long since the expensive price and the lack of powerful computer and graphic technology. After the Oculus, many field start to experiment and use it as an important tool. Especially in Architecture, Gaming, Movie, Medicine and Education field. 

**1.3.1 Architectural Visualization**

5 Steps to Make VR a Reality in Your Practice By MICHAEL KILKELLY (https://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/5-steps-to-make-vr-a-reality-in-your-practice_o)

((CO Architects discovered that VR helps fill in unknowns during the design process. Exploring a concept model in a fully immersive environment allows architects and clients to understand it better. Likewise, VR lets designers test different options at full-scale early in the process. VR also has visceral appeal. “Not everyone can read drawings,” says CO principal Eyal Perchik, AIA, “but everyone can relate to VR.” In the firm's VR mock-ups of complex lab and healthcare spaces, doctors and nurses could virtually work in a space, testing its layout and scale long before it's constructed. Currently, all projects at CO employ VR in some capacity.

[Hickok Cole Architects](http://www.hickokcole.com/) in Washington, D.C., began exploring VR through its in-house [iLab](http://www.hickokcole.com/ilab/research-innovation/) program, which provides micro-grants for employees to research new ideas and technologies. Recipients Carlyn Luu, a project architect, and Howard Mack, a design technology specialist, explored potential applications of VR tools in design, presentation, and marketing. In design, Luu and Mack used VR to highlight unresolved issues at the forthcoming [International Spy Museum](https://www.spymuseum.org/), for which Hickok Cole is the architect of record. By sharing the VR model with the client, they realized that they could not curate carefully styled views of the project as they could with conventional 3D renderings—the client could explore the model however they saw fit. Hickok Cole is currently using VR on three projects with plans to roll it out on more projects soon.))



**1.3.2 Modeling, Designing and Planning**

[[15+ Best VR Apps for Design Work and 3D in 2019]](https://vrtodaymagazine.com/vr-design-apps/)

There are many VR applications focusing on designing and modeling in a virtual environment, especially for industrial designers, artists, and players. VR controllers are needed in most of the design program. By using these VR design applications, you can create and modify your design in a 3D space and human scale instead of flat static screen. It is more like using your whole body to construct design in 3D space. 

**[[Medium]](https://www.oculus.com/medium/)** by Oculus is one of the best 3D digital sculpting VR apps, especially in the game industry. It is used to create and paint digital sculptures by Oculus Touch controllers. Medium is easy to use and filled to the brim with features for you to polish up your creations before exporting them into your game engine of choice. *"Create with digital clay in virtual reality"*

It allows you to get creative inside your browser, with plenty of creation tools available for you to unpack. A bit alternative, but we can appreciate the ones pushing the boundaries of what’s available without having to download actual software to your hard drive.

**[[Tilt Brush]](https://www.tiltbrush.com/)**: Similar to the VR apps above, Tilt Brush is a room-scale 3D painting virtual-reality application available from Google. *"Your room is your canvas. Your palette is your imagination. The possibilities are endless."*



**1.3.3 Training and Education**

[[Virtual Reality in Military]](https://thinkmobiles.com/blog/virtual-reality-military/)

One your the primary use of VR in early stage is doing training in military. It could simulate the essential or dangerous situation in virtual environment, and train the soldier / student without worry about the physical harm and expensive cost on equipment. Battle experience, flight or navy training, these all could be done by Virtual Reality. There are some examples:

- US Army FORT BRAGG, N.C. is developing a VR program that will provide a realistic training program with minimum risk to life and health of solders. The program allows squads to maintain their battle experience or prepare for new missions.
- Striker VR, to train shooting skills. The company works to equip their product, a haptic VR Gun, with best tactile feedback system on the market. Effects include single shot, out-of-ammo, three round burst, chainsaw, pulse rifle replicants. One more feature of the gun is complete portability and free movement.
- UCVR company created a model, identical to an original bazooka, which works with HTC Vive headset. 1:1 high copy model, equipped with force feedback vibration system, weighing 2,8 kg with the maximum 2,100 m range of action and 300 m maximum effective range.

It is also a great tool for educational purpose since

##### 1.5 How to convert Design into VR?

**1.5.1 By Rendering Software**

Rendering is an important process for landscape architects to better represent design to clients. Most of the designers are familiar with one or more rendering software. Since the mature of the virtual reality technology in market, the major render software start to integrate Virtual Reality function into the new version. Lumion 9.0, V-Ray RT 4.0 and KeyShot's KeyVR have all been equipped with such function. And there are some new rendering software with VR output increasing in the market. Enscape is one of the most popular ones. 

Three VR rendering software will introduce below, Enscape, Lumion and Vray. Simple guilds of how to use them to export VR will be provided.

**Enscape**: a real-time rendering and virtual reality plugin running on multiple platforms including SketchUp, Rhino, Revit, and ArchCAD. The advantage of Enscape includes extremely fast response on rendering and export, and realistic rending effect on light, color and material.  For a 1920X1080 perspective rendering, Vray needs about an hour, while Enscape only needs 5 seconds. For 2 minus animation video, Vray needs 25 hours, while Enscape only needs 2 minus. 

 Consider to learning gap for the beginner, Enscape is the most simple one I have ever use. Without complicated parameters, It still could present an sharp beautiful image. The smart material of grass and water, and Enscape library provide a really convenient resource for landscape architects to represent the major landscape environment in a few clicks. 

Virtual Reality in Enscape is easy too. Once connected the vr headset and controller to computer, you could experience the 1:1 scale immersive design spaces. Walking through the place, changing the time of the day, altering the display style, all these operation could be done inside VR. 

Enscape Guild: 

- Install Enscape for your modeling software (could be SketchUp, Rhino, Revit or ArchCAD). 
- Check if your VR device is work correctly on your PC. Currently, Enscape supports HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Windows Mixed Reality headsets. Check the official websites and documents of specific device if you have problem initiate or connect the device on PC.
- Open the model that you want to experience in your design modeling software (SketchUp, Rhino, Revit or ArchCAD). Or open an empty file, then creating some 3D objects and spaces.
- Click the start icon of Enscape in the modeling software. Check the real time rendering preview, see if the material or environment are best represented. Adjust the model or material accordingly. (*Material controls in Enscape are a little bit different from each modeling software. For example, in Rhino 5, there is no Enscape material editor. Enscape basically use the Rhino native material editor as the control. In Rhino 6 and SketchUp, Enscape provide its own material editor. When applying specially material like grass or water, you just include the keywords - grass / water in the material name, then adjust its parameters in Enscape setting - grass rendering or water rendering. *)
- Check your VR headset is connected. Click the VR headset icon to start the VR. 
- Put on the head set and grab the controller, there will be some simple tutorial showing you how to navigate through or adjusting the immersive environment through the controller.
- Stop it by click the VR headset icon again.

Tips: 1. Learn how to use the grass and water material, it has really awesome result in rendering. 2. Use Enscape elements provided in Enscape Library. They are all high quality 3D models having great rendering effect. 3. Adjust the atmosphere setting to best express the surrounding. Like using hdri environment image (see tutorial: download real location hdri from google street), setting for light temperature, fog, clouds and so on.



**Lumion**: one of the famous landscape rendering software with rich of 3D object library and great animation function. It starts to support VR in Lumion 9. However, It is kind of a fake VR with panoramas images. It is rending specific location as panoramas image, then project the panoramas into the VR headset. It is an static image. There is no way to walk through or interact with the space. However, you could still create a serious of view point to compose a immersive tour. Lumion VR has some special  setting for GearVR / Oculus (cubic panorama format) headsets and generic devices (equirectangular projection panoramas). 



**V-Ray RT**: V-Ray is one of the best world leading rendering software from Chaos Group. It supports almost all different of modeling software. Normal V-Ray (Adv.) is the CPU version of V-Ray, while V-Ray RT is the GPU version of of V-Ray, which could better support high quality graphic rendering. Similar to Lumion, V-Ray do not has ability to create a immersive walkthrough, but static panoramas image instead. The version that could better integrate VR is the V-Ray RT for 3ds Max. With the help of a MAXScript, it is possible to update the position of the camera with a game controller to move around in the virtual environment while V-Ray RT updates and refreshes the render from the new camera location. However, it is still a complicated inefficient solution to sell design through VR. 



**IrisVR**: is a new software that mainly focuses on converting Building and Architecture model in to virtual immersive experience. It works with SketchUp, Revit, Navisworks, Rhino files in Oculus Rift, Oculus Quest, HTC Vive, and Windows Mixed Reality. IrisVR creates an immersive walkthroughs and VR meetings in simple one click. 



**1.5.2  By Game Engine**

Gaming is the biggest industry by employing virtual reality. Game engine certainly will include the function of VR as an important part of system. The most popular game engine on the market, Unity3D and Unreal Engine, are all supporting export VR right now.

For landscape designer, it is easy to convert 3d model from SketchUp or Rhino into Unity3D and Unreal Engine. And it is not hard to build an interactive virtual landscape environment through these Game Engine even without programming knowledge. 

Unity3D and Unreal has similar functionality. However Unreal Engine has great graphic quality, while, Unity3D has great asset store and easy to learn.

Comparing to rendering software, there are many advantages by using Game Engine to produce VR:

- Rendering software are extremely expensive, while game engines are free (except exceed the limit of profit) and easy to access.
- Game Engines have very high customization in terms of animation, programming, special effects, and sound.
- Ability to build highly interactive and responsive programs and spaces.
- Amazing resource of 3D elements, scripts, plugins in the gaming world.
- Besides VR, Game Engines supports all kinds of cutting edge formats output like Augmented Reality (AR), Web App, iOS, and Android.

Following is the tutorial to import Rhino/Sketchup model into Game Engine and Build simple interactive scene in Virtual Reality.

**Unity3D**: "a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies. As of 2018, the engine had been extended to support more than 25 platforms. The engine can be used to create three-dimensional, two-dimensional, virtual realtiy, and augmented reality games, as well as simulations and other experiences. The engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming, such as film, automotive, architecture, engineering and construction." 

Unity3D Guide: 

- Install the latest Unity Software on your operation system (Windows or macOS). 
- Open the Unity and create a new project in a folder. You may need to register a free account to use Unity. 
- Open your 3d model (Rhino, SketchUp, 3ds Max, Maya...), export the model as fbx, or dae format.  (You also can use [[Walk-Through-3D]](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/walk-through-3dtm?etx=) plugin for rhino to export to Unity, if your project is working in rhino.
- Drag the export model and texture folder to the Unity project folder.
- Click the dae or fbx in Unity browser, in the last tab of texture and material, choose extract material ....
- Import as solid???
- Directly drag the converted dea or fbx into Unity model space, or ....
- Click on the asset store tab, search the standard asset...

**Summary**

Landscape Architects are definitely worth to trying and applying these awesome visualization technologies. They are bringing another level of design experience and quality for designers and clients. They have been broadly spread on the internet and market. And it is barrier-free process from traditional 3D model to an immersive experience. Learning is needed for new knowledge. However, its potential value for efficient design and high quality presentation is tremendous. 

Currently, some clients and architecture firms requires the VR or AR presentation of the project. Some techy person in the firm brought VR into the office and experiment it during the design. It is the trend of the industry. The firms or designers who have this skill will be much competitive in the market.
