Chapter 9: ESRI

ESRI (Environmental Systems Research Institute) is an international supplier of geographic information system (GIS) software, web GIS and geodatabase management applications. ArcGIS is one of the most famous GIS products around the world from ESRI. 

In this chapter, we will introduce other two useful tools from ESRI besides traditional ArcGIS Desktop software: ArcGIS Online and CityEngine. 

9.1 ArcGIS Online

9.1.1 Introduction to ArcGIS Online

"ArcGIS Online is a collaborative web GIS that allows you to use, create, and share maps, scenes, apps, layers, analytics, and data. You get access to content in ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World, ArcGIS apps, and cloud infrastructure, where you can add items; publish web layers; and create maps, apps, and scenes."

Comparing to the expensive ArcGIS Desktop software, ArcGIS Online is free for noncommercial use once you have a public account. You can create, store, and manage maps, scenes, and apps and share them with others. You also get access to content shared by ESRI and GIS users around the world. It is a similar mapping product as Mapbox introduced previously in Chapter 7. However, it does not have ability to dealing with the 3d geospatial data like ArcGIS Desktop do.

9.2 CityEngine

9.2.1 Introduction to CityEngine

"CityEngine is a three-dimensional modeling software application developed by ESRI and is specialized in generation of 3D urban environments. With the procedural modeling approach, CityEngine supports the creation of detailed large-scale 3D city models. It has been heavily used in Urban Design and Game Development.
