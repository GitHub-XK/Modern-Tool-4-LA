Chapter 7: Mapbox

If we say the OpenStreetMap is the Data Resource, the Mapbox is the beautification of the data, or application of the data. The map data in Mapbox is basically coming from the OpenStreetMap. Google map, OpenStreetMap, BingMap, Apple Map only have 2 or 3 different view themes, while Mapbox could have infinite styles of maps and various combination of data sets. 

7.1 Introduction to Mapbox

7.1.1 What is Mapbox?

Mapbox is the location data platform for mobile and web applications. We provide building blocks to add location features like maps, search, and navigation into any experience you create. (https://www.mapbox.com/about/)

In another word, Mapbox can help you customize your map, and apply it into your website, smart phone application, games, augmented reality... 

Since it mainly sold to technology or internet related companies, how could it used by landscape architects? While, your could think it as an GIS beautification tool, like illustrator plus data of OpenStreetMap. It can make beautiful map base for project site analysis or master plan rendering. 

7.1.2 Mapbox Studio - Styles, Tilesets, Datasets

(https://docs.mapbox.com/studio-manual/overview/) 

If you like to start your own map, Mapbox Studio is the tool you need to use. However, you need an account first before you can access anything. After login, Go to the page of [Mapbox Studio](https://studio.mapbox.com/). Here you can start your new style from multiple templates.  After building, your map would be should in your styles list.

There are three different tabs on the top of the Mapbox studio: Styles, Tilesets, and Datasets. Styles is easy to understand, while what is the tilesets and datasets? 

In datasets, you could create new dataset by adding points, strings, polygons, images into the map. Dataset save your data abstractly. If you like to visualize the data you created, you have to convert it into tileset. Go to the page of tileset, create a new tileset by importing the previous dataset. In tileset editor, you could visualize its looking at 22 preset zoom levels. 

The final step to import customized data into styled map is to add the tileset into the styles you created by styles editor.
