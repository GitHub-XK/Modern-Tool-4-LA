Chapter 10: Data Visualization

10.1 Introduction to Data Visualization

10.1.1 What is Data Visualization

Data Visualization is a sub-branch of Data Science. Instead of showing the large amount of abstract numbers, data visualization could represent the data in a beautiful way, in an understandable way, in a summary way. It is a powerful skill for designer to present important information, ideas, or arguments. Without the process of data visualization, people could hardly understand the raw data, the information behind the data, and the value of the data. 

In landscape architecture field, we call it infographic instead of data visualization. Drawing the infographics could vividly show the site / design analysis result / summary to the clients without go through the numbers or calculations to the clients. Good infographics could also be part of the design presentation. 

However, most our infographic skills still stay at Microsoft Excel, Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop. Comparing to data visualization tools in data science, our tools are really out of date and inefficient. This chapter will introduce some new tools borrowed from data science and business, see how we could visualize data in different ways.



10.1.2 Modern Visualization Methods

Followings are the most popular visualization tools. Some are really easy to learn and use, some need certain programming knowledge to work on.  This chart will show the comparison of these tools.

10.2 Data Types and Data Resources

10.2.1 Data Types

Visualization could not be done without data. Data is the important foundation of data visualization. Data generally means value and information. However, it store in different specific formats. The most common one, for example, Microsoft Office Excel format (.xls). Some format we may not familiar or have seen before, but are broadly used in Computer Science, like CVS, SQL, JSON, and so on. These formats are generated from different program, while they all could be imported into the data visualization tools introduced previously. 

Excel Data / XLS

Database / SQL

CSV

JSON

10.2.2 Data Resources

Where can we get the relevant data before visualizing them. There are 3 different major data resources:

First-hand Data: the data generated by author himself. We create this type of data resource by ourselves.

Second-hand Data: the data generated by other people or agencies. In order to get this type of data resource, we need ask authors or agencies for help.

Third-hand Data: the original dataset has been reorganized or transformed into another dataset by third party. The most data resources on the internet are the third-hand data. We will mainly focus on the method to get third-hand data from internet.

First place, you should check out the relevant agencies or government official website, see if they share the information to the public.   

Second, go to the websites blew and search for your topic.
