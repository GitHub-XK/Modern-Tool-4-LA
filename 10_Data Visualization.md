Chapter 10: Data Visualization

10.1 Introduction to Data Visualization

10.1.1 What is Data Visualization

Data Visualization is a sub-branch of Data Science. Instead of showing the large amount of abstract numbers, data visualization could represent the data in a beautiful way, in an understandable way, in a summary way. It is a powerful skill for designer to present important information, ideas, or arguments. Without the process of data visualization, people could hardly understand the raw data, the information behind the data, and the value of the data. 

In landscape architecture field, we call it infographic instead of data visualization. Drawing the infographics could vividly show the site / design analysis result / summary to the clients without go through the numbers or calculations to the clients. Good infographics could also be part of the design presentation. 

However, most our infographic skills still stay at Microsoft Excel, Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop. Comparing to data visualization tools in data science, our tools are really out of date and inefficient. This chapter will introduce some new tools borrowed from data science and business, see how we could visualize data in different ways.



10.1.2 Modern Visualization Methods

Followings are the most popular visualization tools. Some are really easy to learn and use, some need certain programming knowledge to work on.  This chart will show the comparison of these tools.

10.2 Data Types and Data Resources

10.2.1 Data Types

Visualization could not be done without data. Data is the important foundation of data visualization. Data generally means value and information. However, it store in different specific formats. The most common one, for example, Microsoft Office Excel format (.xls). Some format we may not familiar or have seen before, but are broadly used in Computer Science, like CVS, SQL, JSON, and so on. These formats are generated from different program, while they all could be imported into the data visualization tools introduced previously. 

Excel Data / XLS: spreadsheet format created by Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet program. It contains one or more worksheets, which store and display data in a table format. XLS files may also store mathematical functions, charts, styles, and formatting.(https://fileinfo.com/extension/xls)

Database / SQL: a database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Structured Query Language (SQL) is one of the most commonly used relational database management system. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)

CSV / TSV: Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file is a delimited text file uses a comma to separate values. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)

JSON: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is an open-standard file format or data interchange format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute-value pairs and array data types. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)

XML: Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)



10.2.2 Data Resources

Where can we get the relevant data before visualizing them. There are 3 different major data sources:

First-hand Data: the data generated by author himself. We create this type of data resource by ourselves.

Second-hand Data: the data generated by other people or agencies. In order to get this type of data resource, we need ask authors or agencies for help.

Third-hand Data: the original dataset has been reorganized or transformed into another dataset by third party. The most data resources on the internet are the third-hand data. We will mainly focus on the method to get third-hand data from internet.

First place, you should check out the relevant agencies or government official website, see if they share the information to the public.   

Second, go to the websites blew and search for your topic.

[[Kaggle Public Dataset]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets): Kaggle is the biggest online community of data scientists and machine learners. It allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment. It contains over 14,000 public datasets for free use. 

[[Google Trends]](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore): a website by Google to analyze the popularity of top search queries in Google Search across various regions and languages. 

[[National Climatic Data Center]](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/quick-links):

[[Data.Gov]](https://www.data.gov/):The home of the U.S. Governmentâ€™s open data

The last method is to generally search the key words and type of data from Google. It is the most broad way but least accurate way to get the data. 

Sometimes, there is no any related information about specific topic out of the US. You should definitely search the topic in other languages with local search engines like Yandex.ru, baidu.com, or yahoo.jp.

Besides the pure data formats, do not forget the hidden data in images, audios, videos, and 3D objects. It may take some efforts or researches to extract useful data from these multi-medias. 



10.3 Organize Data

Before visualize the data, there is another important step to make sure the data is organized and ready to export to visualization programs. Most of the time, the data from the internet may not be the exactly information we needed. Cleaning, combining, slicing data, reorganizing them to be the most accurate and concise information we needed. 

10.3.1 Excel

One of the easiest way to organize the dataset is using Microsoft Office Excel. Excel can not only read the Excel formats ( like .xsl or .xlt), but also the other popular data formats like .csv and .xml. For .sql or .json, there is no direct way to open in excel. However, you can convert them to .csv through some tools or websites. 

[[https://www.convertcsv.com/sql-to-csv.htm]](https://www.convertcsv.com/sql-to-csv.htm)

[[https://codebeautify.org/sql-to-csv-converter]](https://codebeautify.org/sql-to-csv-converter)

[[http://beautifytools.com/sql-to-csv-converter.php]](http://beautifytools.com/sql-to-csv-converter.php)

Once the data is in Excel, you could use basic functions to sort, slice, combine, calculate the data to reorganize. Attached chart includes some useful commands and shortcut to organize data. Check more Excel Skills on the official website.

10.3.2 Python

Python is the most popular programming language to processing datasets. It has awesome open-source frameworks/libraries to use when dealing with the data problems. 

General Data: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas

Big Data: Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Samza, Flink



10.4 Visualization Tools & Tutorials

10.4.1 Web Apps & Software

Tableau, Google Charts, Grafana, FusionCharts, DataWrapper, Infogram

Most of the Web Applications and Softwares are straightforward enough to use without too much learning. However, it may need some diggings and tweaking if you want to build an astonishing infographic. Tableau is the most popular visualization software on the market, especially in field of business, finance, and natural science. Check out the [[Tableau Public Gallery]](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/?tab=viz-of-the-day&type=viz-of-the-day) to see some awesome projects created by Tableau. 

10.4.2 JavaScript Frameworks

D3.js, Sigma.js, Chartist.js

JavaScript Frameworks and Python Frameworks are much complicated since it needs some programming knowledge and has no user interface to interact with. Each framework has its unique usages to process and visualize the data. You have to follow the methods according to the official documents. The advantage of using programming language's frameworks is that you could have more controls on the graphics than the standard templates of the web app. Once you follow the tutorials and documents on the website, it is not as difficult as you thought.

10.4.3 Python Frameworks

Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn, ggplot, Altair

10.4.4 Processing

"Processing is an open-source graphical library and integrated development environment (IDE) built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching non-programmers the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context. "

"Processing uses the Java language, with additional simplifications such as additional classes and aliased mathematical functions and operations. It also provides a graphical user interface for simplifying the compilation and execution stage."

"The Processing language and IDE were the precursor to other projects including Arduino, Wiring and p5.js."
